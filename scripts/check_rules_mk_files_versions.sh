# NOTICE
# For the given hardcoded list of packages sources below, this script scrolls corresponding versions declared in "rules/{pkcgsrcname}.mk" files
# and then compares them to the ones available with the command "apt-cache showsrc {pkcgsrcname}".
# If the configured full version is available, nothing will be done.
# The sources shall be retrieved later with the command 'apt-get source {pkcgsrcname}={version_full}" w/o any trouble.
# NB:  Though, if the latest available version in "apt-cache showsrc" matching the (base) version declared  in "rules/{pkcgsrcname}.mk"
#      is different than {fullversion}, a warning will be issued on stderr to encourage an update.
# If the configured full version is not available, there are 2 possibilities.
# - If there is an available version in "apt-cache showsrc" matching the (base) version declared,
#   "rules/{pkcgsrcname}.mk" {version_full} value will be modified on-the-fly to use it.
#   If several matching versions are available, the latest one will be preferred.
# - If none is available, the script will exit with an error code and stops the whole compilation process.
#   This will prevent starting a long build process condamned to fail and thus spare precious time and computing ressources.
#   NB: This is the main purpose of this script.

# TODO 2023/01/16
# Following packages are currently not supported and have not been migrated yet to "apt-get source" & "apt-cache showsrc"
#   ixgbe : not an official debian package
#   libyang2 : this package is only available in the testing repo and does not work for the moment with 'apt-get source'
#              https://udd.debian.org/lintian/?packages=libyang2 "libyang2 2.1.4-2 error source-is-missing [doc/compat_report.html]"
#              'apt-cache showsrc' works => might be used with dget and this script rather than wget
#   lldpd: no corresponding base version available
#   thrift_0_14_1: no corresponding base version available / conflict name with thrift
