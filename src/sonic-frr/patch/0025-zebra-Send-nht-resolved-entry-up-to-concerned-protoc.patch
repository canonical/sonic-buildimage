Subject: [PATCH] zebra: Send nht resolved entry up to concerned protocols in
 all cases

There existed the idea, from Volta, that a nexthop group would not have
the same nexthops installed -vs- what FRR actually sent down.  The
dplane would notify you.

With the addition of 06525c4
the code was put behind a bit of a wall controlled the usage
of it.

The flag ROUTE_ENTRY_USE_FIB_NHG flag was being used
to control which set was being sent up to concerned parties
in nexthop tracking.  Put this flag behind the wall and
do not necessarily set it when we receive a data plane
notification about a route being installed or not.

Fixes: #12706
